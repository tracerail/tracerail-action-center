# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/ for more about ignoring files.

# Dependencies
# This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages)
# and is typically very large. It should not be committed to Git.
# When you clone the repository, you will run `npm install` to regenerate this directory.
/node_modules

# Build directory
# This directory contains the optimized, minified, and transpiled code that is ready
# to be deployed to a production server. It is generated by running `npm run build`.
/build

# Testing
# This directory is generated by test runners (like Jest) to store coverage reports.
/coverage

# Environment variables
# These files contain environment-specific variables and potentially sensitive data
# like API keys. They should never be committed to the repository.
# A `.env.example` file can be created (and committed) to show what variables are needed.
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Logs
# These files are created by npm or yarn to log debug information.
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Editor directories and files
# These are configuration files for various code editors.
# It's best to keep these out of the repository to avoid clutter.
.idea
.vscode
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace

# OS-generated files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
