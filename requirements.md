# High-Level Requirements for Tracerail Action Center

This document outlines the high-level requirements for the `tracerail-action-center` project. The goal is to create a modern, professional, and real-time user interface for **Agents** to manage and resolve their assigned **Cases**.

## 1. Project Vision

The Tracerail Action Center will be the primary interface for human agents to interact with business workflows. It will be a centralized hub for managing support tickets, operational tasks, and any system-driven process that requires human judgment. The application will provide a seamless and efficient experience, empowering Agents to quickly assess, prioritize, and act on their work.

## 2. Core Terminology

To ensure clarity and consistency, the project will adhere to the following terminology:

| Term              | Definition                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Case**          | The primary record or unit of work that an Agent acts upon (e.g., an expense report, a support ticket).       |
| **Activity Stream** | The chronological log of all events, messages, and interactions within a single Case.                          |
| **Agent**         | The primary human user of the Action Center. Their job is to resolve Cases by acting on them.              |
| **AI Agent**      | The automated system that can analyze, enrich, and take autonomous action on Cases.                          |
| **Manager**       | A user who primarily views aggregate data and performance metrics in the separate Dashboard UI.                      |

## 3. Core Features (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)

These are the essential features required for the initial release of the Action Center.

### 3.1. Unified Case List

*   **Description:** The main view of the application should display a list of all Cases assigned to the Agent.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Displays a list of Cases, which can be sorted and filtered.
    *   Each list item provides at-a-glance information (e.g., Case Title, Status, Timestamp).
    *   An indicator should be present for unread or updated Cases.
    *   Selecting a Case from the list will open the main `Case View`.

### 3.2. Case View Layout

*   **Description:** A dedicated, three-pane view for managing a single Case. This layout is designed to provide maximum context and efficiency for the Agent.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  **Left Pane:** The `Case List` remains visible, allowing the Agent to switch between Cases easily.
    2.  **Center Pane (`Activity Stream`):** Displays the chronological history of the Case. This includes user comments, system events, AI analysis, and the active `Interaction Presenter` for the current task.
    3.  **Right Pane (`Case Details Panel`):** A panel that continuously displays the Case's core, structured metadata (e.g., Status, Assignee, Created Date, Due Date, and any relevant data like Customer ID or Order Number).

### 3.3. Dynamic Agent Interactions

*   **Description:** The UI must present Agents with contextual and structured interactions defined by the backend workflow, enabling them to act decisively on a Case.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   The UI can render different interaction models (Action Buttons, Simple Forms, Complex Forms, etc.) within the Activity Stream based on instructions from the backend.
    *   Agent submissions from these components are sent back to the workflow as structured data.
    *   Once an interaction is completed, it is replaced in the Activity Stream with a summary of the action taken (e.g., "Agent [Name] approved this request.").

### 3.4. Authentication and Authorization (via SSO)

*   **Description:** The application must be secure and accessible only to authenticated Agents, handled via a centralized Single Sign-On (SSO) service.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    *   Unauthenticated users are redirected to the central Tracerail SSO service.
    *   After successful authentication, Agents are redirected back to the Action Center and are fully logged in.
    *   Agents can navigate between the Action Center and other Tracerail UIs without re-authenticating.

## 4. AI Agent Capabilities

The AI Agent is a core component of the system, designed to augment human Agents and automate routine tasks.

### 4.1. Pre-Processing and Analysis
Before a Case is presented to a human Agent, the AI agent can:
*   **Enrich Data:** Parse attachments to extract and validate information.
*   **Detect Anomalies:** Compare the Case against historical data to flag unusual activity.
*   **Check Policies:** Validate the Case against defined business rules.
*   **Generate Summaries & Risk Scores:** Provide a concise summary and a risk score (Low, Medium, High) in the `Case Details Panel`.

### 4.2. Autonomous Actions (Auto-Pilot)
The AI agent is empowered to autonomously handle Cases that meet a high-confidence, low-risk threshold.
*   **Auto-Approval:** The AI directly approves low-risk, in-policy Cases.
*   **Auto-Rejection:** The AI rejects Cases with clear, non-negotiable policy violations.

### 4.3. Human Interaction Assistance
When a Case requires human judgment, the AI can assist by:
*   **Drafting Responses:** Pre-filling form fields with suggested text.
*   **Providing Contextual Actions:** Dynamically suggesting relevant actions.

## 5. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

### 5.1. Dashboards for Service Delivery Management

*   **Description:** A dedicated interface for Managers to view operational performance and analytics.
*   **Architectural Note:** This will be a **separate UI application** (`tracerail-dashboard-ui`) to maintain a clean separation of concerns between the Agent and Manager personas.

### 5.2. Advanced Search and Filtering

*   **Search:** A global search bar to find Cases by keyword, metadata, or activity.
*   **Filtering:** Advanced filtering options for the Case List (e.g., by Status, Assignee, Due Date).

### 5.3. Case Management

*   **Status Changes:** Ability for an Agent to manually change the status of a Case.
*   **Snoozing:** Ability to "snooze" a Case, temporarily removing it from the active queue.

### 5.4. Rich Content Support

*   Displaying images, links, and formatted text within the Activity Stream.
*   Allowing Agents to attach files.

### 5.5. In-App Notifications

*   Real-time visual feedback for new or updated Cases.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1. Performance
*   **LCP:** < 2.5 seconds.
*   **TTI:** < 5 seconds.
*   **View transitions (e.g., opening a Case):** < 500ms.
*   **Real-time Updates:** < 1 second.

### 6.2. Usability and Accessibility
*   **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
*   **Usability:** System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 70+.

### 6.3. Security
*   **Communication:** TLS 1.2 or higher.
*   **Vulnerability Protection:** Protection against OWASP Top 10.
*   **Dependencies:** Regular vulnerability scanning and patching.

### 6.4. Reliability
*   **Uptime:** 99.9%.
*   **Error Rate:** < 0.1% of all user sessions.

## 7. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend Framework:** React
*   **Styling:** CSS or a CSS-in-JS library (to be decided)
*   **State Management:** React Context or a dedicated library like Redux or Zustand (to be decided)
*   **API Communication:** Fetch API or a library like Axios. Real-time communication will likely be handled with WebSockets.
